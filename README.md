      Open the solution in the microsoft visual studio IDE and start making your own version of the game. 

2. ### Vsiual studio code 
      1. Prepend **../Header/** path in the relative include path in every *.cpp* file already mentioned
      For example 
      *#include "matrix.hpp"* change this to #include "../Header/matrix.cpp"  
      Do the same with every cpp file
      2. Navigate to **source** directory of the project in the integrated terminal  
      and Execute the following command to compile and run .exe file  
       1. To compile and generate exe file  
           ``` 
             g++ --std=c++14 -o  ..\..\Executable\MatrixNumberShift  .\GameUtility.cpp .\main.cpp matrix.cpp .\matrix1.cpp
            ``` 
            The above command will create an exe file in the Executable directory and by double clicking it you can run your game.
